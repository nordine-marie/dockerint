#+TITLE: Stamp assignment submissions

These scripts can be used to batch process all files submitted in a
Moodle assignment resource, so as to convert files to PDF, and add a
header containing the name of the student and its number in Moodle.

The tools operate in the following process :

1. download the =.zip= archive which contains all submissions

2. unzip the contents. This should create as many subdirs as
   submissions received, named like ='Anne ONYMOUS_12345_assignsubmission_file_/'=

3. cd to the main repository containing all these extracted subdirs,
   and launch the script:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     ~/[...]/stamp-assignement-submissions/stamp-submissions.sh
   #+END_SRC

   This will produce stamped PDF files for each submission, named like
   the subdir: ='Anne_ONYMOUS_12345-stamped.pdf'=

4. join all these stamped files into one single PDF file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC 
   ~/[...]/stamp-assignement-submissions/join-stamped-pdf.sh
   #+END_SRC
