Description of the contents of that directory

This directory contains sources for the front-end Web UI.

The UI can be previewed with any Web server providing the contents over HTTP.

For instance, with :
```
php -S localhost:8000
```

The UI would then be available over http://localhost:8000/

Real deployment would of course require a real Web server (TBD).
